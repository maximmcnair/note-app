# Note taking app

This is taking the javascript challenge. I have followed the suggested UI, however I have implemented routing with separate pages rather than a modal for the note views, because I think this works better on mobile and allows deep linking.
With more time I would add these features:
- Add edit/delete UI. I have added the redux actions, but haven't added the ui for these features.
- Add rich test editing using Facebook's Draft.js https://draftjs.org/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
